# Rust Learning Path

Collection of resources for learning the Rust programming language.

## Status

This is a work in progress started on 2022-10-22 and shall be on version 1.0 at 2024-01-31.

## Goal

The goal is to evaluate the currently available resources for learning the Rust programming language to set together a collection of resources. The collection shall form a path for learning Rust in a complete way, within minimal time and effort.
