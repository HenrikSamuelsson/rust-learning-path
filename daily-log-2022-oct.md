### Learning Rust for Embedded Systems

Read the blog [Learning Rust for Embedded Systems](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1432.php) and downloaded the pdf version for future reference. Stored pdf version on my personal google drive in a folder called learning-rust.

Two takeaways from this blog. Firstly the list of new concepts in Rust and their mapping to concepts in other programming languages. Secondary is the linked resources in the blog that will be used for future exploration of Rust.

### Why Rust won't replace C

Watched the video [Why Rust won't replace C (just yet anyway)](https://youtu.be/ojEXMM_1bVA) on YouTube.

Well balanced discussion on benefits and challenges if to move away from C for embedded projects and instead use Rust.

Benefits are that Rust is safer, built in support of elements that requires third party tools such as static code checkers, good support for multi threaded applications. Challenges is that it requires the developers to learn a new language and possibly also start using new tools, can be hard to get the team and management motivated and understand the long term benefits.

### Installation Work Computer

Rust can for Windows be installed by following the instructions at [Rust - Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Turned out that I had installed Rust already on my work computer.

```txt
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.61.0 (fe5b13d68 2022-05-18)
