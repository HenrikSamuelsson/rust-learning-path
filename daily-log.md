### Learning Rust for Embedded Systems

Read the blog [Learning Rust for Embedded Systems](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1432.php) and downloaded the pdf version for future reference. Stored pdf version on my personal google drive in a folder called learning-rust.

Two takeaways from this blog. Firstly the list of new concepts in Rust and their mapping to concepts in other programming languages. Secondary is the linked resources in the blog that will be used for future exploration of Rust.
