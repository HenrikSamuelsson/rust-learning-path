# Statement

The term *statement* means an instruction in Rust source code that do something but do not return a value.

## Assignment Statements

Assignment of a value to a variable is a statement.

```Rust
let num = 5;
```

## Expression Statements

An expression statement is one that evaluates an expression and ignores its result. As a rule, an expression statement's purpose is to trigger the effects of evaluating its expression.

```Rust
v.pop();          // Ignore the element returned from pop
```
