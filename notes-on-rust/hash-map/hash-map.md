# Hash Map

A collection type in Rust is the hash map. `HasMap<key, value>` can be used to store data where a `key` is mapped to a `value`. The `key` is used to look up the `value`. One example would be to store names and telephone numbers. Here the name would be the `key` and the telephone number the `value`.
