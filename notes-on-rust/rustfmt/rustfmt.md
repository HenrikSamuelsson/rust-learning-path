# rustfmt

Rust have a code formatter called *rustfmt*. The purpose of this tool is to have a standardized way to format Rust source code. The code becomes easier to read and understand when it always follows familiar formatting patterns.

A Rust installer, like rustup, will typically include rustfmt by default.

rustfmt can be run in a terminal by the use of cargo. Use the following command to format the code in the current crate:

```txt
cargo format
```
