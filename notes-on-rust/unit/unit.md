# Unit Type

Rust have a primitive type denoted by `()`, it also goes by the name unit type. The unit type can not carry any information by design, it has exactly one value `()`.

The purpose of the unit type is to have a value to use as result type when there is no meaningful value to use.

A use case is to have a function that returns `()`. It also so that a function will implicitly return `()` if leaving out what the function shall return.
