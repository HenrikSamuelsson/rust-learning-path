# Basic Compilation

It is here explained how to write and compile a simple Rust program. The way we compile here is a very basic way and in reality this is not how Rust is generally compiled. We do this exercise just to learn a little bit what happens under the hood when using higher level tools to compile Rust code into an executable.

## The Rust Compiler

Rust programs must be compiled before they can be executed. Compilation means that source code written by a developer is translated into instructions that a computer can execute. The Rust compiler is installed on the computer when installing Rust. It is hence a requirement to have Rust installed to be able to do a compilation.
