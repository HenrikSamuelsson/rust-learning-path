# Data Types

Variables in Rust shall have a given type. There are several different built-in types in the language. The built-in types can be complemented with user-defined types.

## Statically Typed

Rust is a statically typed language meaning that the the type of all variables in the code must be known at compile time. The type can be explicitly stated in the code by the developer. The type can also sometimes be inferred by the compiler by looking at the value that is bound to the variable.

TODO discuss different types.
